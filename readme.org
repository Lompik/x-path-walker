#+TITLE: Navigation feature for JSON/XML/HTML based on path (imenu like)

This package is a imenu like feature for JSON, XML/HTML files. It let
you jump to line in the file based on the xpath for HTML files and
JSON structure.

* demo

Example :

[[file:Demo/xpathwalker-2016-01-14_18.04.29.gif]]

* Install

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'x-path-walker)
#+END_SRC

** Requirement for python
   - the ~lxml~ libraries (both python package and the C libraries) are neewd if you're looking into HTML/XML.
The preferred way to install this dependency is by your system's package manager. However you can try your luck with:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install lxml (--user)
#+END_SRC

* usage
Currently only Helm front end is implemented (and python backend). Once you are in a [HX]ML or JSON buffer:

~M-x~ helm-x-path-walker


* todo

  - YAML backend
    - Currently the [[http://pyyaml.org/][PyYAML]] package for python does not keep the original layout of the data (as it goes to a dictionary)
  - This package first started with the ~jq~ backend for JSON. But the python version is more efficient. It could be made optional though.
